I am a 2nd year PhD candidate at [CREST](https://crest.science/),  [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) under the supervision of [Pauline Rossi](https://sites.google.com/site/paulinerossimoulin/home) since September 2023.

My interest lies broadly in **Demographic Economics** and **Family Economics**. More precisely I am working on issues related to fertility, marriage, divorce and childlessness and their interactions, using structural models.

I also worked on optimal taxation and microsimulation as research assistant with [Pierre Boyer](https://pierrecboyer.com/) and on life expectancy inequalities as an economist at [**Institut des Politiques Publiques**](https://www.ipp.eu/) during my 1st year of PhD.
